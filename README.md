# SSD: Single Shot MultiBox Object Detector, in PyTorch
A [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) implementation of [Single Shot MultiBox Detector](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325) from the 2016 paper by Wei Liu, Dragomir Anguelov, Dumitru Erhan, Christian Szegedy, Scott Reed, Cheng-Yang, and Alexander C. Berg.  The official and original Caffe code can be found [here](https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd).

A [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) implementation of [KL Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08545) from the 2019 paper by Yihui He, Chenchen Zhu1, Jianren Wang, Marios Savvides, and Xiangyu Zhang.  The official and original Caffe code can be found [here](https://github.com/yihui-he/KL-Loss).

## Datasets
### VOC Dataset
PASCAL VOC: Visual Object Classes

##### Download VOC2007 trainval & test
```Shell
# specify a directory for dataset to be downloaded into, else default is ~/data/
sh data/scripts/VOC2007.sh # <directory>
```

##### Download VOC2012 trainval
```Shell
# specify a directory for dataset to be downloaded into, else default is ~/data/
sh data/scripts/VOC2012.sh # <directory>
```

## Training SSD
- First download the fc-reduced [VGG-16](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556) PyTorch base network weights at:              https://s3.amazonaws.com/amdegroot-models/vgg16_reducedfc.pth
- By default, we assume you have downloaded the file in the `ssd.pytorch/weights` dir:

```Shell
mkdir weights
cd weights
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/amdegroot-models/vgg16_reducedfc.pth
```

- To train SSD using the train script simply specify the parameters listed in `train.py` as a flag or manually change them.

```Shell
python train.py
```

- Note:
  * For training, an NVIDIA GPU is strongly recommended for speed.
  * For instructions on Visdom usage/installation, see the <a href='#installation'>Installation</a> section.
  * You can pick-up training from a checkpoint by specifying the path as one of the training parameters (again, see `train.py` for options)

## Evaluation
To evaluate a trained network:

```Shell
python eval.py
```

You can specify the parameters listed in the `eval.py` file by flagging them or manually changing them.  




## TODO
The performance is not so good as expected, which we hope to complete in the near future
- Still to come:
  * [ ] I need to figure out why is not so good as expected
  * [ ] Need more training
  * [ ] Tune the hyperparameters
